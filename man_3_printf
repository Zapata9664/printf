To print an simple array you need to do the following:
_printf("Holberton is a good school\n"); The response to that function would be "Holberton"

If you want to use an option it would go like the following:
_printf("Holberton %s\n", "is a good school");
The response would be "Holberton is a good school", the %s understand that it need to print a
string

If you want to print a character
_printf("%c\n", 'H');
The response would be H with a new line.

If you want to print an integrer
_print("%i\n", 9);
The reponse would be 9 with a new line
