Hi everyone 👋


# _printf("Create the function")


## Description 📜.
The purposeof this project is create the function from Zero, the project was make with tools as WSL and Visual Code with languaje of programming C, using some concepts for example like:

- Variadics functions.
- pointers to functions.

Making a merge of this for reach the goal of the function printf, recreating flags as integer, char and string and dectecting when there is a double percent for printing only one of them. the main challenge was implemented the new tools WSL and Visual Code, this enviromets is new for the team and second the logical for conect various functions is very important and challenging.

2. Check the correct repository and files.
3. Run this command in the terminal for compile all files ended in .c : "gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c"
4. Check te file ended in .out and execute.

## How to Use the Project 💬.

The project has tree important parts:
dear
1. The file _printf.c is the root file, in this file found the builder of list of argumentsm, the call of every functions and the begin and the finish the variadic functions.
2. The second file important is main.c this file allocate the prototypes of the functions.
3. the other files are the functions nedeed for the execute the functions in the file _printf.c 

### This is an examaple that how use _printf
